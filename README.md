# Calendar App

### This is a calendar application where you can save events, modify them and delete them. At the moment it is only the graphical interface and the events are stored in a store made with redux-toolkit.

### Now the application has interaction with the backend for the authorization part, only the CRUD is missing for the events that will be saved in mogo DB

## Available Scripts

### `yarn dev`
